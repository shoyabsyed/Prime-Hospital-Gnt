        title: "Refraction with Computerized Eye Testing",
        description: "Refraction is a critical aspect of eye examinations used to determine the appropriate prescription for eyeglasses or contact lenses. Our optometrists utilize tools like a phoropter or retinoscope to assess how light enters the eyes, correcting refractive errors such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. Accurate refraction ensures clear and comfortable vision correction. At Andhra Prime Hospitals, we employ advanced computerized eye testing technology to assess visual acuity, detect refractive errors, and evaluate overall eye health. This precise approach aids our optometrists in prescribing accurate eyewear solutions, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and enabling timely detection of eye conditions for improved vision care and patient satisfaction."

        title: "Management of Glaucoma (Investigation/Medical/Laser/Surgery)",
        description: "The management of glaucoma involves a series of diagnostic tests to diagnose and monitor its progression. These tests include measuring intraocular pressure, assessing optic nerve health through visual field tests and OCT scans. Early detection and ongoing investigations are crucial for implementing timely treatments to preserve vision. Treatment for glaucoma includes medical management with eye drops or oral medications to control intraocular pressure. Laser therapies such as trabeculoplasty and iridotomy aim to improve fluid drainage. In severe cases, surgical options like trabeculectomy or shunt implantation effectively manage glaucoma and prevent vision loss."

        title: "Diagnostic Services & Eye Exams",
        description: "Our diagnostic eye services offer comprehensive examinations to assess vision, detect eye disorders, and identify potential health issues. Skilled optometrists perform tests including visual acuity assessments, refraction, tonometry (eye pressure measurement), and detailed examinations of the retina and optic nerve. Regular eye exams are essential for early detection and prompt treatment of eye conditions to maintain optimal vision care."

        title: "Preventive Eye Check-up",
        description: "Preventive eye check-ups involve routine screenings to evaluate visual acuity, eye health, and overall ocular well-being. These proactive evaluations help detect eye problems such as cataracts, glaucoma, or age-related macular degeneration early on. By addressing issues promptly, preventive check-ups promote visual wellness, reduce the risk of vision loss, and preserve eye function."

        title: "Visual Fields (Perimetry)",
        description: "Visual field testing, or perimetry, evaluates the full extent of a person’s field of vision. It aids in identifying peripheral vision loss, which may indicate conditions like glaucoma or neurological disorders. Regular visual field tests are essential for monitoring eye health and detecting changes in the visual field over time."

        title: "Squint Work-Up / Diplopia Charting",
        description: "A squint work-up involves assessing strabismus (crossed eyes) and diplopia (double vision) through a comprehensive examination. Our optometrists evaluate eye alignment, muscle balance, and visual symptoms to determine the appropriate treatment, which may include glasses, eye exercises, or surgical intervention."

        title: "Color Vision",
        description: "Color vision assessments determine an individual’s ability to perceive and distinguish different colors. Specialized tests such as the Ishihara test identify color vision deficiencies, including red-green color blindness. Understanding color vision is crucial for certain occupations and can provide valuable insights into potential eye health issues."

        title: "Management of Diabetic Retinopathy",
        description: "Diabetic retinopathy, a condition that can lead to vision loss in diabetic patients, is diagnosed through comprehensive eye examinations. These include assessments of visual acuity, retinal examination, intraocular pressure measurement, fluorescein angiography to detect abnormalities in retinal blood vessels, and OCT to detect retinal swelling. Treatment typically involves laser therapy, and in some cases, newer treatments like intraocular injections may be utilized before laser therapy or surgery to manage the condition effectively."
