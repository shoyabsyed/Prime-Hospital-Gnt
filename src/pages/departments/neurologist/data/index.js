    description:
      "Brain surgery is a complex medical procedure aimed at treating various conditions affecting the brain. Our surgeons carefully navigate the delicate structures of the brain to remove tumors, repair damaged blood vessels, or alleviate pressure caused by swelling. With the induction of the latest technologies and techniques at our Neurosurgery Department, our team of neurosurgeons is able to perform more precise and minimally invasive surgeries, leading to improved patient outcomes and faster recovery times.",

    title: "Spine Surgery",
    description:
      "Spine surgery involves diagnosing and treating spinal conditions that cause pain or affect mobility. Surgeons use specialized techniques to correct spinal deformities, repair herniated discs, or stabilize the spine after trauma. Minimally invasive approaches, such as endoscopic or robotic-assisted procedures, have revolutionized spine surgery by reducing scarring, pain, and recovery time. These advancements enable patients to regain mobility and quality of life more quickly. In our specialized Neurosurgery Department, we provide advanced spinal instrumentation, stabilization, and fusion procedures tailored to treat various spinal conditions, helping patients restore mobility and enhance their quality of life.",

    title: "Peripheral Nerve Surgery",
    description:
      "Peripheral nerve surgery involves diagnosing and treating conditions affecting the peripheral nervous system. Surgeons perform procedures on nerves outside the brain and spinal cord to repair injuries, relieve pain, or restore function. Common treatments include nerve decompression to alleviate compression or entrapment, nerve grafting for repairing damaged nerves, and neuroma excision to remove painful nerve tissue. The goal of peripheral nerve surgery is to restore sensation, improve mobility, and enhance overall function.",

    title: "Functional Neurosurgery",
    description:
      "Functional neurosurgery addresses conditions like movement disorders, chronic pain, or epilepsy that do not respond to traditional treatments. We provide innovative procedures such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), and epilepsy surgery at our Neurosurgery Department. These advanced treatments aim to enhance quality of life by alleviating symptoms and improving overall well-being.",
